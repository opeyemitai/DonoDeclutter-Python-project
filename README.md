## About DonoDeclutter

The DonoDeclutter platform helps to transform how we sell, buy, and donate items with ease and security, right here in Nigeria. 
## Purpose

To Create DonoDeclutter platform to transform how we sell, buy, and donate items with ease and security, right here in Nigeria.  Insights gotten were crucial to build a platform that reflects your needs and supports our community.

## Description

In this project primary data was gotten from 115 respondents. â€¢ Data cleaning was used to clean the datasets to check for any errors or inconsistencies in the data and also	ensured that responses are coded consistently and accurately.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Based on the analysis of the dataset, it was found that a significiant portion of respondents, particularly those aged between 25 and 34, participated in the survey. This suggests that individuals within this group are predominant users of decluttering platforms.

## Geographic Analysis

The data indicates that Lagos had the highest number of respondents, with 31 participants showing significant interest in contributing to the dataset. Following closely behind was Anambra, with 30 respondents. This suggests that individuals from Lagos and Anambra exhibited a notable interest in participating and providing insights for the dataset compared to other locations.

## Relationship between Location and Frequency of decluttering

The majority of respondents indicated that they declutter their home or personal space on a weekly basis. Interestingly, individuals located in Jos reported engaging in decluttering activities more frequently on a weekly basis compared to other locations.

## Challenges in Selling or Donating Analysis

Out of the respondents, 69 individuals stated that they don't encounter challenges with decluttering. However, 32 persons expressed difficulties in finding buyers for their products, while others reported facing issues related to low pricing. Utilizing this decluttering application could potentially address these challenges and facilitate improved sales of products, thereby mitigating issues related to finding buyers and pricing concerns.

## Reasons for Decluttering Analysis

In the analysis of reasons for decluttering, it was found that 33.8% of respondents cited seasonal cleaning as their primary motivation. Additionally, an equal proportion of 33.8% indicated the need for more space at home as their reason for decluttering. Furthermore, 12.0% of respondents stated that they were preparing to move or migrate, underscoring the various motivations behind decluttering practices.

## Preferences for Platform Features Analysis

Approximately 58 participants expressed a preference for features including:

Ease of listing items
Security and privacy measures
Ability to reach a wide audience
User-friendly interface
Transparent and fair pricing
Reliable customer support
These preferences indicate a desire for a platform that offers convenience, safety, accessibility, simplicity, fairness, and support for users engaging in decluttering activities.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the analysis revealed significant insights that underscore the importance and potential impact of developing a decluttering application.

Demographic Insights: The majority of respondents, particularly women aged 25-34, are actively engaged in decluttering activities, with varying frequencies and motivations.

Regional Preferences: Locations such as Lagos and Anambra show a notable interest in decluttering, with specific age groups and frequency patterns(particularly women, fell within the age range of 25-34).

Disposal Methods and Challenges: There's a diverse range of disposal methods used by respondents, with a significant number expressing challenges in finding buyers or managing pricing.

Awareness of Second-hand Platforms: A considerable proportion of respondents currently lack a platform for decluttering, indicating a significant market gap that our application could fill.

Reasons for Decluttering: Respondents declutter for various reasons, including seasonal cleaning, the need for more space, and preparation for moving or migration.

Impact of Moving or Migration: The process of moving or migrating often prompts individuals to declutter, with preferences for selling items for extra funds or donating to make a positive impact.

Feature Preferences: A majority of participants expressed preferences for features such as ease of listing items, security measures, wide audience reach, user-friendly interface, transparent pricing, and reliable customer support.

These findings collectively highlight the opportunity and demand for a decluttering application that addresses the diverse needs and preferences of users. By incorporating these insights into the development process, we can create a robust platform that not only simplifies the decluttering process but also fosters a positive user experience and promotes sustainable practices.
